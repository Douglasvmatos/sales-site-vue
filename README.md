## üíª Project

The website created for sales can be to sell products or services directly to customers. The website can be an e-commerce platform, where customers can browse products, add items to the cart, and complete the purchase online. Additionally, the website can be used to promote products or services and direct customers to a physical store or service location. In some cases, the website can also be used to collect customer information, such as email addresses, for future marketing campaigns. In summary, the objective of a website created for sales is to offer a convenient and accessible way for customers to purchase your products or services, increasing visibility and sales opportunities.

To include a login option on a website, you can create a login page where users can enter their email address and password to access their account. The login page can be accessed by clicking on a "login" or "sign in" button on the website's homepage or navigation menu.
